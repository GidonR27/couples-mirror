💞 Couple's Flourishing Questionnaire
A tool for understanding the health, resilience, and long-term viability of your relationship—based on principles from systems that help humans thrive.


Solo Phase
Each partner plays through. One after the other they play a series of questions based on the chapters/dimensions below:

incorporate also all the descriptive sentences mentioned, essence, goal, and quotes.     
Take each dimension 3-4 guiding questions mentioned. Create an answer range in the style (which is below the questions) for each question. 
Each screen and question should be animated in and out, in a classy fashion.  
After the “range” questions… ask the “last” question (noted “last” in doc) these are to get the mind thinking, not needed for later “range” calculations.
💞 Duo (Joint) Phase
When both are done they continue together , the story merges:
* Take into account solo range questions 
* Where both partners rate a low range, this will be the first duo chapter they receive. And so on by order.
* In each dimension section below you can also find the “duo” questions to present to the users 
* Allow to skip to next dimension questions after 3 questions.
* On each dimension end before skipping/moving to the next one. Show a screen with the “explain what you make of this sentence to your partner” (title and also the sentence according to each section)

🌞 Resolution
They see their rebuilt world bloom — literally fractal architecture growing in light patterns — symbolizing the alignment they achieved.
At the end, they receive 2 recommendations (action ideas) for the crucial dimensions (lowest rated) to try and accomplish during the coming week

Dimensions and experience
Tone: Intrigue + intimacy.
 reflective shimmer effect.
Visual copy:
Before two people can see each other clearly, each must first look inward.
 This experience is not a test — it’s a reflection.
 Answer honestly. Follow intuition. Each choice shapes what you’ll explore later.

1. 🌱 Truth Alignment -  Your truth takes shape when seen
Theme: Honesty, transparency, reality contact in the relationship.
Goal: Discover how clearly each partner sees themselves, each other, and the shared reality.
Guiding questions:
   * Do we feel safe telling each other the truth — even when it’s uncomfortable?

   * Are there topics we avoid, minimize, or distort?

   * When conflict arises, do we seek understanding or validation?

Examples of range:
      * 🩶 Low: “I hide things to avoid conflict; we keep the peace by pretending.”

      * 💚 Medium: “We share most things but some truths feel too risky.”

      * 🌿 High: “We can tell each other almost anything, knowing it brings us closer, not apart.”

last:
 When was the last time you thought about ending this relationship and why didn't you?
         * Having thoughts, even recent ones, are not “wrong” or ‘bad’. Not sharing them for a long time is more likely to cause harm.


Action idea:
 Choose one area (finances, intimacy, parenting, emotional needs) where you’ll practice “truthful curiosity” this week — not accusations, but gentle inquiry.


duo-
         1. Think about the last time you thought something about your partner but didn’t want to share it? 
Say it now, explain why you feel this way, partner most not follow up till after the game

         2. Do we ask questions when we don’t understand each other? Do we listen?

         3. When was the last time you admitted you were wrong? 
Describe what you make of this sentence:
Truth emerges from contrast and perception, not just statements. Silence and observation can be more honest than explanation.

            * Does my partner encourage my individuality, or feel threatened by it?

            * Do we celebrate each other’s small and large growth moments?

            * Do we make time for joy, play, and creativity — or just maintenance?

Examples of range:
               * 🩶 Low: “We mostly manage logistics. Growth feels separate.”

               * 💚 Medium: “We support each other’s goals, but forget shared excitement.”

◻ Didn't really engage
◻ Felt threatened or unsupportive

Action idea:

                           5. Do we feel we’re allowed to change, grow, and evolve—or do we have to "stay the same"?

                                 * 🌿 High: “Conflict is uncomfortable but helps us grow closer and wiser.”

Action idea:
 Practice one repair ritual — e.g., saying “I see your point,” or ending conflict with gratitude (“Thank you for being honest, even when it’s hard.”)
Last:
recall one way you helped your partner change for the better.”

Feedback loops are the engine of learning — the capacity for change, repair, and resilience.It ensures life can continue amid entropy and shock.

“When these five dimensions align, purpose arises naturally.
Meaning and direction aren’t imposed — they emerge as the field of coherence itself.
A flourishing system knows where it’s going because it is fully alive.”
